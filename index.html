        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>My name is Carl Radke. I am a Senior at Brigham Young University-Idaho majoring in Computer Information Technology. When I began my university studies, I was planning on going into healthcare but changed my mind after taking a couple of classes on coding. Technology is where my true interest was, and I enjoyed every opportunity to learn more and gain IT experience. My favorite subject has been networking, and I continue in my personal time to study the official CCNA Certification Guide.
        </p>

        <p>
            To help showcase the things I have learned, I have compiled various projects and work from my studies on GitHub. This work, along with a list of relevant classes and their descriptions, are featured on this GitHub webpage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for your consideration,
        </p>
