    <h1>Carl Radke</h1>
    <p>My name is Carl Radke, and I am a student at Brigham Young
    University Idaho. I find technology very interesting, so I have
    decided to major in CIT to learn all I can about computers.
    I have no coding experience before my studies at BYU-I, but I
    have enjoyed the opportunity to learn these skills in my
    programming classes.</p>
